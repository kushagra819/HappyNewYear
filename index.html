            <p>A whole year...We made it!!! Though we may not had a good start, the road bumps we faced together as well as individually but we did make it!! There were times we almost gave up on each other, just cuz of a petty misunderstanding & things I created, but eventually you held back and made the way through it & we got hard and petty stuff out of the way & our bond grew more stronger & trustful than before. 
              </p>
            <p>There were some hard times but we did have great moments too...Imagica, though we had a few rides together drop tower, roller coaster but we enjoyed a lot, next time soon we must go somewhere...you like heights right, now we must go somewhere with more heights, how about skydiving?</p>

            Though we didn&apos;t hang out together much but really had many great moment together. I still remember how we started with ice-cream & panipuri dates and eventually ending the year with ice-cream. I really love spending time with you, I don&apos;t know but whenever you are there with me I feel soo good & it just makes me happy & whenever I make you laugh or try to bring a little smile on that face and then you say that I made your day, eventually it makes my day that I could draw a little happiness to you. I'm forever grateful to you Urja, Love You More&#10084;</p>

            <p>I can't count how many things you've done for me but thank you for being the most amazing friend I could ever asked for. Thank you for listening to my stories, gossips and random rants. Thank you for always being there for me when I needed. Nothing can express how grateful I am to have a friend like you, Remeber that I'm always here if you ever need a shoulder to lay onto. <p>I can't wait to see what's in the store for us next year, with new moments & memories. I wish you all the good things you wish for yourself & may you achieve them. Now, we get to continue to grow together and work on our careers.</p>
